# Data lab notebooks

This GitHub repo contains several tutorial notebooks designed to present the essentials of R, Python and pandas.
The notebooks were authored by research assistants of the Data Lab at Bentley University in Waltham, MA (just outside of Boston).
Please direct any feedback, comments or suggestions to David Oury <doury@bentley.edu>. Thanks. 

==========================================
The notebooks are forked from Data Lab, but R and SQL files are not able to run directly from Python ikernal setup. Python folder is updated to reflect my personal exercise. Please msg me if you have any questions or want to quote my work. Thanks.
