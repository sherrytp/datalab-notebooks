  In the previous notebooks, we covered atomic vectors.    
     In this notebook, you will get to learn three ways to create augmented vectors from atomic vectors.
## Factor vectors

Factors are used to represent categorical data. They are stored as integers and have corresponding labels for each integer.

For instance, blue corresponds `1`, green corresponds to `2` and red corresponds to `3`. See the command below. This integers may be different when you run the command below, but in practice we use the labels (not the integers.) 

See: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/factors.html
Factor vectors are often created from character vectors.

```{r}
as.factor(c("red", "green", "blue", "blue")) -> rgb
rgb
```

Notice though that the levels are in alphabetical order.

```{r}
levels(rgb)
```

In case it's necessary for the levels to be in a certain order, the factor() command can be used. Consider the following example in which the vector importance denotes the different levels of importance a task might have.

```{r}
importance=as.factor(c("medium","low","high"))
importance
```

It would be better if the levels of the factor importance were in ascending order of importance.

```{r}
importance=factor(importance, levels=c("low", "medium","high"))
importance
```

The _type_ of a vector indicates how it is __stored__.

```{r}
typeof(rgb)
```

The _class_ of a vector indicates how it is __used__.

```{r}
class(rgb)
```

## Date and Date-time Vectors

Date/date-time vectors are usually created from character vectors. 

One of the easiest ways to work with dates is to use the `lubridate` package/library. 

See: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html

```{r}
library(lubridate)
```


```{r}
lubridate::dmy("22 April 2018") -> my_date
my_date
```


```{r}
lubridate::dmy("April 22, 2018") -> my_date
my_date
```


```{r}
lubridate::mdy("April 22, 2018") -> my_date
my_date
```


```{r}
?lubridate()
```


```{r}
class(my_date)
```


```{r}
lubridate::ymd_hm("1956-12-31 23:50") -> my_date_time
my_date_time
```


```{r}
year(my_date_time)
```


```{r}
day(my_date_time)
```


```{r}
wday(my_date_time, label=TRUE)
```

See the link https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html for time zones, time intervals and arithmetic with times.
### Dataframes and Tibbles

Dataframes and tibbles are ways of storing tables in R. 
- Dataframes (`data.frame`) are part of the base R installation. 
- Tibbles (`tibble`) come from the `tibble` package/library, which is part of the `tidyverse` library.

Dataframes are introduced by the notebooks in `/Data Lab Notebooks/R/Essentails/Dataframes`.

Tibbles will be introduced, but at this point I don't know where. (Stay tuned.)
needs_work - Tibbles__
__Exercise__: Use a lubridate function to create a date object from the string "Sep 11, 2017" and store this in a variable named `my_date`.

Display the contents of this variable. 

 Search online for lubridate documentation to find the proper function to use.
__Exercise__: Use a lubridate function to create a date-time object from the string "11 Sep 2017 7:30" and store this in a variable named `my_datetime`.

Display the contents of this variable.
