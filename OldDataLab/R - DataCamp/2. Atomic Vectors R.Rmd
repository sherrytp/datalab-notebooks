```{r}
%md
Vectors are the most basic R objects, and they come in two flavours: lists and atomic vectors.

Atomic vectors contain only one type of value while list vectors can be a combination of different types of values. 

 In this notebook, you will learn about atomic vectors.
```


```{r}
%md
There are 4 common types of atomic vectors: logical, numeric(double), character and integer.
```

### Creating Atomic Vectors

There are several ways of creating vectors of length greater than `1`.

The two basic ways are:
1. The concatenation function `c()`
2. The colon operator `:` (works only with numeric vectors)
3. Generating a sequence of numbers is by using the `seq()` command

```{r}
c("the", "brown" , "fox", "hello")
```


```{r}
c(234,34,-356,2249999)
```


```{r}
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```


```{r}
10:20
```


```{r}
7:0
```


```{r}
3:-3
```

Another method of generating a sequence of numbers is by using the `seq()` command

```{r}
seq(from=3, to=-3, by=-1)
```


```{r}
seq(from=1, to=10, length.out=5)
```

### Naming vectors

Vector elements can be named:
- with the `c()` function, when they are created 
- with the `names()` function, after they have been created

```{r}
c(x = 3, y = 20, z = 100)
```


```{r}
7:10 -> y
c("a","b","c","d") -> names(y)
y
```

Note: Naming fewer elements than those in a vector does not generates errors. Naming more elements than those in the vector, on the other hand, generates errors.

```{r}
7:10 -> z
c("a","b") -> names(z)
z
```

### Length of vectors

The `length()` function returns the number of elements in a vector.

All values from the notebook `1. Values` are atomic vectors of length `1`.

```{r}
length(c("Hello","bye"))
```


```{r}
length(35)
```


```{r}
length(TRUE)
```


```{r}
length(11:18)
```


```{r}
length(c("a","b","c"))
```


```{r}
length(c(TRUE, FALSE))
```


```{r}
length(c(1, NA, 3))
```

### Subsetting Vectors

- Single elements can be retrieved from a vector. 
- Collections of elements can be retrieved from a vector.
Retrieve single elements from a vector by using square brackets containing the position of the element to be retrieved.

```{r}
x = c("dog", "fish", "cat", "blue", "red", "green")
x[5]
```

Collections of elements can be retrieved by placing a vector of positive integers inside the square brackets. 

This returns all elements at positions specified by these integers.

```{r}
y
```


```{r}
y[c('a','c')]
```


```{r}
y[2:3]
```


```{r}
y[c(1,4)]
```


```{r}
x = c("dog", "fish", "cat", "blue", "red", "green")
x[6:1]
```

The `NA` value is returned if the position integer does not specify an item in the vector. This happens when the position integer is greater than the length of the vector.

```{r}
x[c(6,1, 1, 1, 100)]
```


```{r}
length(x)
```


```{r}
y = x[length(x):1]
```


```{r}
y
```

Collections of elements can also be retrieved by placing a vector of __negative integers__ inside the square brackets. 

In this case, all elements of the vector are returned, __except__ for those in the positions specified by the absolute values of each integer. i.e. specifying the position as -1 leaves out the first element or -4 leaves out the fourth element.

```{r}
x
```


```{r}
x[-1]
```


```{r}
x[c(-1)]
```


```{r}
x[c(-4,-1)]
```

Logical vectors can also be used to retrieve elements.

```{r}
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

### Operations on Vectors

Arithmetic operations can be performed on vectors, just as well as single values, when:
- the vectors are the same length
- at least one of the vectors has length of `1`

```{r}
1:2
```


```{r}
1:4
```

If two vectors are of unequal length, the values in the shorter vector are repeated until its length matches the larger vector and then operations are performed.

```{r}
1:4 + 1:2
```


```{r}
c(1,2,3) * 4:6
```


```{r}
10 * 1:3
```

There are situations where you can perform arithmetic on two vectors of different lengths, __but don't do this.__ 

In the case where the vectors are of different lengths, the length of the longer vector __must be__ a multiple of the length of the shorter vector.
### Comparing Vectors

Two vectors of the same length can be compared using relational operators. See the link below for a list of these operators:
- https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Comparison.html

For example,

```{r}
c(1,2,3,4) < c(4,3)
```

The elements of a vector can be compared to a vector with a single element.

```{r}
1:10 < 5
```


```{r}
c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
```


```{r}
1:10 == 10
```

Eileen: what is the difference between "=" and "=="  When should we use "=" and when should we use “==”？
### Functions on Vectors

There are many functions that take a vector as input. Here are some of the common ones. 

See also: http://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html
#### Functions on Numeric Vectors

The most common functions on numeric vectors are: `sum`, `min`, `max`, `mean`. Those and a few others are listed below.
First create a vector `x` to use in the examples.

```{r}
1:4 -> x
x
```


```{r}
sum(x)
```


```{r}
prod(x)
```


```{r}
min(x)
```


```{r}
max(x)
```


```{r}
mean(x)
```


```{r}
sd(x)
```


```{r}
round(c(1.254342, 3.0, 4.42523459), 2)
```


```{r}
sort(c(4,8,1,3,5,2), decreasing= TRUE)
```

#### Functions on Character Vectors

The most common functions on character vectors are `nchar`, `tolower` and `toupper`.

```{r}
c("Live", "long", "and", "prosper") -> y
y 
```


```{r}
nchar(y)
```


```{r}
tolower(y)
```


```{r}
toupper(y)
```

Substr() can be used to extract parts of a string. It can also be used to replace parts in elements in a character vector.

```{r}
substr("abcdefg", start=2, stop=3)
```


```{r}
c("mat", "car", "say") -> p
substr(p, 1, 1)<- "#"
p
```


```{r}
c("mat", "car", "say") -> p
substr(p, 2, 3)<- "##"
p
```


```{r}
?substr
```

__Exercise__: Create a vector named `over_half` that contains only those numbers from vector `my_vec` (see below) which are greater than `0.5`. 
Then take the average of these numbers (that are greater than `0.5`.) 
Store your result in variable `over_half_avg`.
The End
